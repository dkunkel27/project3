    <p><strong>what:</strong> Green-on-Mind is proud to present the speakers and date of its next monthly event! As
        always, it will be virtual
        to lower attendees' carbon footprint to travel, save money and resources, and to broaden accessibility for
        anyone wanting to join. It is primarily for designers, as speakers will refer to design terminology, but anyone
        is welcome. In this conference, we will hear from three speakers: Emma Fanning, Michelle Fehler, and Suhaila
        Sikand, focusing on ways designers can ensure their practice is more sustainable.</p>

        <p>12PM-12:45PM</p>
        <p>
            After searching for a year for other sustainable designers (and finding none), I decided to discover the
            niche independently, founding Little Fox Design, a sustainable branding and packaging design studio.
            <strong>Little Fox has worked with dozens of clients to create brands that are built for the future of
                clients’companies and the environment.</strong> This talk will go over how we work with clients and keep
            design
            green throughout the entire process.

            <p>Biomimicry professional, visual communication designer, & educator at The Design School at ASU</p>

            <p>
                I am a Biomimicry Professional and a Visual Communication Designer who is passionate about connecting
                Nature’s strategies to design. <strong>My research focuses on defining and creating tools for a
                    life-centered
                    design thinking methodology that allows the infusion of biomimicry thinking into the traditional
                    human-centered design process.</strong> I am a professor teaching various multi-disciplinary design
                studios at
                The Design School at ASU and also teach the capstone course for the online MS in BMY program. I have
                presented my work at various conferences including World Usability day, AIGA Y-conference, AIGA PHXDW,
                SustainbleUX, Audubon society, and Target HQ. My work has been published in the Cooper Hewitt’s Summer
                2019 Design Journal among other peer reviewed journals.

            <p>Climate designer, exploring community, equity, behavior, & design</p>
            <p>2PM-2:45PM</p>
            <p>
                As a social impact and climate designer, I am grounded in community, equity, and sustainability.
                Unfortunately, human-centered design doesn’t always support these principles with the right intentions.
                Instead of seeing a problem in a community, let’s get invited to work with the community. Instead of
                interpreting people’s needs, let’s include them in the process. <strong>Human centered design implies a
                    surface
                    level engagement where the power of design remains with the designer, not the community.</strong>
