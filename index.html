        <p>
            After searching for a year for other sustainable designers (and finding none), I decided to discover the
            niche independently, founding Little Fox Design, a sustainable branding and packaging design studio.
            Little Fox has worked with dozens of clients to create brands that are built for the future of clients’
            companies and the environment. This talk will go over how we work with clients and keep design green
            throughout the entire process.

            <p>Biomimicry professional, visual communication designer, & educator at The Design School at ASU</p>
            <p>
                I am a Biomimicry Professional and a Visual Communication Designer who is passionate about connecting
                Nature’s strategies to design. My research focuses on defining and creating tools for a life-centered
                design thinking methodology that allows the infusion of biomimicry thinking into the traditional
                human-centered design process. I am a professor teaching various multi-disciplinary design studios at
                The Design School at ASU and also teach the capstone course for the online MS in BMY program. I have
                presented my work at various conferences including World Usability day, AIGA Y-conference, AIGA PHXDW,
                SustainbleUX, Audubon society, and Target HQ. My work has been published in the Cooper Hewitt’s Summer
                2019 Design Journal among other peer reviewed journals.
